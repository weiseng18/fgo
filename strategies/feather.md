### Actions

| Wave | Skills                                           | NPs                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Jeanne 13, Waver 23                              | Jeanne NP                              |
| 2    | Jeanne 2, Waver 1 (on Jeanne), MC 12 (on Jeanne) | Jeanne NP + 7-8k face card damage      |
| 3    | Santa Alter 23                                   | Santa Alter NP + ~70k face card damage |

### Notes

The ~70k face card damage is not as bad as it sounds because of the following:

- Getting Santa Alter cards = class advantage = 2x damage
- Summer Jeanne 2x NP = 20 crit stars, Santa Alter Lvl 9 Instict = 13 crit stars, so a total of 33 crit stars guarnateed

### Potential for improvement

Based on NP1 Lvl 100 Summer Jeanne,

- Refunds 28% on Wave 1
- Chance of **not** clearing the lower HP enemies in Wave 2 **without** MC 1

Because of the above pointers, we are locked into using a MC that

- Gives at least 2% NP charge
- Any kind of offensive buff (Attack Up, NP Damage Up, Arts Up)

Ideally, if Summer Jeanne is NP2, the above requirements may not need to be fulfilled. In that case, use Arctic Mystic Code for Attack Up + NP Damage Up buff on Santa Alter.
